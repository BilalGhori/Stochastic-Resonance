# Emergence of stochastic resonance in a two-compartment hippocampal pyramidal neuron model
This repository contains the model code and the graphic data to reproduce the main results presented in [1].
## Installation
To install the code, clone or download the repo, navigate to the Model Code directory of the repo and enter the command in the terminal: (python setup.py install)
## Reproduce the results
1. Go to Model Code/ directory and enter the command in terminal: python setup.py install
2. To generate data for Supplementary Figures S8, Enter the command in terminal: python Run_Simulations_cPRmodelwIh.py
3. Go to the Figures directories using MATLAB (version R2020a/b recommended, prerequisites include Machine Learning Toolbox and Signal Processing Toolbox) and reproduce the main results.
Note: A memory of at least 28 GB is needed to run all the simulations. We provided the graphics data to reproduce the main results.
